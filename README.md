Business Understanding:
The Playlist feature significantly enhances the Clubber TV user experience by allowing users to curate and organize their favorite matches in one place, making it easier to access and enjoy the content they love. It also offers personalized control, where users can manage their playlist, ensuring they never miss important matches. This feature promotes engagement, as users can quickly add and revisit matches based on their preferences.

Feature Suggestion:
One small improvement would be to implement push notifications that alert users when a match from their playlist goes live. This would ensure users never miss a match theyâ€™ve saved, further enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

# MySportsPlaylist

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.11.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
